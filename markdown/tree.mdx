# Gradient Boosted Trees for Predicting SPY

Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT) are designed to uncover hidden, non-linear relationships among multiple financial assets to predict SPY (S&P 500 ETF) movements.

## How It Works

- **Decision trees** split data into branches based on specific rules, such as SPYâ€™s prior day return.
- Easy to interpret and effective for capturing simple patterns, but they struggle with complex relationships and generalization.

- **Gradient Boosting** enhances decision trees by:
  - Iteratively training on errors made by previous trees to refine predictions.
  - Combining weak learners (shallow trees) into a powerful ensemble model.
  - Capturing non-linear relationships and variable interactions that simpler models miss.

## Practical Takeaway

- **Predictive Power**: GBT models uncover complex patterns in financial data, enabling accurate predictions for SPY movements and aiding portfolio decisions.
