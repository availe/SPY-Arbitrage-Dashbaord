# Introduction

Welcome to our project, where we delve into the dynamic world of financial markets through the lens of **quantitative modeling**. Our primary goal is to **predict market regimes**—specifically **bullish**, **bearish**, and **sideways** trends—by leveraging advanced statistical techniques.

By accurately identifying these market conditions, we aim to develop a backtesting model for the **SPY ETF** (which tracks the S&P 500 index) that can potentially **outperform the market based on historical data**.
