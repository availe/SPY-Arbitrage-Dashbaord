# Introduction

Welcome to our project, where we delve into the dynamic world of financial markets through the lens of **quantitative modeling**. Our primary goal is to **predict market regimes**—specifically **bullish**, **bearish**, and **sideways** trends—by leveraging advanced statistical techniques.

By accurately identifying these market conditions, we aim to develop a backtesting model for the **SPY ETF** (which tracks the S&P 500 index) that can potentially **outperform the market based on historical data**.

## Our Approach

1. **Collecting and Cleaning Financial Data**  
   Ensuring data accuracy by sourcing reliable financial data and preprocessing it to eliminate inconsistencies.

2. **Generating Additional Features**  
   Creating new variables and indicators that provide deeper insights into asset behavior.

3. **Building a Predictive Model using Hidden Markov Model (HMM)**  
   Utilizing HMM to determine market regimes based on observed data.

4. **Training the Model to Forecast Daily Returns**  
   Applying statistical techniques to train the model with historical data.

5. **Backtesting Our Strategy**  
   Simulating the model's performance using historical data to evaluate its effectiveness.

6. **Comparing Performance to Benchmarks**  
   Assessing the model's returns against standard benchmarks like the SPY ETF.

## Project Goals

- **Demonstrate the Application of Quantitative Methods**  
  Show how mathematical models can enhance trading strategies.

- **Make Informed Investment Decisions**  
  Use predictive modeling to anticipate market movements.

- **Enhance Trading Strategies**  
  Develop a model that adjusts to different market regimes for optimal performance.
