# Primer: Understanding Quantitative Modeling in Finance

The financial industry has been transformed by the advent of **quantitative modeling**, which applies mathematical and statistical techniques to solve complex financial problems. This primer introduces key areas where quantitative modeling plays a crucial role.

## Asset Pricing

### Models to Determine the Fair Value of Financial Assets

By assessing factors like risk, expected returns, and market conditions, these models help investors make informed decisions.

  headers={['Model', 'Description']}
  data={[
    {
      Model: '**Black-Scholes Model**',
      Description:
        'Calculates the theoretical value of European-style options based on factors like volatility, time, and risk-free interest rate.',
    },
    {
      Model: '**Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)**',
      Description:
        'Determines the expected return of an asset based on its systematic risk relative to the overall market.',
    },
  ]}
/>

## Risk Management

### Techniques to Identify, Measure, and Mitigate Financial Risk

Managing financial risk is critical for preserving capital and ensuring long-term success.

    },
    {
      Method: '**Stress Testing**',
      Description:
        'Simulates extreme market conditions to assess how portfolios would perform under adverse scenarios.',
    },
  ]}
/>

## Portfolio Management

### Optimization of Investment Portfolios Using Mathematical Algorithms

Balancing risk and return to achieve specific financial goals.

      Description:
        'Assembles a portfolio of assets such that the expected return is maximized for a given level of risk.',
    },
  ]}
/>

## Algorithmic Trading

### Using Automated Systems and Algorithms to Execute Trades

Algorithmic trading utilizes automated systems to execute trades at speeds and frequencies impossible for human traders.

      Description: 'Providing liquidity by simultaneously posting buy and sell orders.',
    },
  ]}
/>

## Derivatives and Structured Products

### Analysis and Pricing of Complex Financial Instruments

Derivatives are complex instruments whose value is derived from underlying assets.
