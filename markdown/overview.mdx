# Introduction

This project focuses on predicting market regimes—**bullish**, **bearish**, and **sideways**—and using these predictions to power a backtesting model for the **SPY ETF** (tracking the S&P 500). By integrating regime forecasting with performance analysis, the model aims to **outperform the market** based on historical data.
